<p>Voices Across the Tide</p>
<p>By Gillian Babb</p>
<p>When I arrived in Mulah and Kolhufushi, I was welcomed into
communities shaped by water, roots, and the rhythm of daily life.</p>
<p>On the island of Mulah, I met women who know a lot about <em>Kan’doo
faa</em> (mangroves). In the Maldives, all women older than 30 are
called “<em>Dhatth</em>a”. The equivalent in Suriname is
“<em>Tante</em>”, which signifies a form of respect for women in both
cultures. I gained a lot of insight from three <em>Dhatthas</em> whose
knowledge of the mangroves is both practical and deeply woven into the
culture, and each revealing a different facet of the mangrove’s place in
island life.</p>

<p>Faaiza, the first <em>Dhattha</em>, demonstrated how to navigate the
dense tangle of roots and mud of the inland mangrove area. Hawwa, the
second <em>Dhattha</em>, spoke of visiting the mangroves mostly when
family came from other islands or the capital. She taught me about
<em>kashikeyo</em>, the screw pine fruit that also grows in mangrove
areas. Her stories painted the area as a treasured retreat, a space for
connection and memory. Aisthu, the third <em>Dhattha</em>, spent more
frequent hours in the mangroves, gathering coconut palm leaves for
weaving thatch roofs and collecting screw pine fruits. Through her
hands-on work, the mangroves became a source of both livelihood and
cultural continuity. Through their stories and demonstrations, I could
sense how deeply they valued the mangroves and believed in preserving
and making them accessible for everyone.</p>

<p>Across the atoll in Kolhufushi, the story is different. Mangroves are
farther from where the people live, and many people have never walked
among the roots. There, I experienced Maldivian <em>Raivaru</em> (short,
rhythmic poems) and traditional singing while conducting surveys at
evening gathering spots. <em>Dhatthas</em> recited <em>Raivaru</em>
about daily life, nature, and love. Since my survey focused on mangroves
and seagrass, the <em>dhatthas</em> recited one that praised lagoons,
reefs, and seagrass beds. Another poem spoke of mangroves and
<em>jinni</em> (supernatural beings) on an uninhabited island. These
songs and poems revealed the importance the community places on these
ecosystems as part of their cultural heritage.</p>

<p>In these communities, the <em>Dhatthas</em> I met are more than
elders. They are keepers of ecological wisdom, stories, and practices
passed down through generations.</p>
<p>Coming from Suriname, where tropical plants and trees are abundant
and many edible fruits are found, I was struck by how much of the
coconut tree is used here. From eating the roots of a sprouted coconut
to roofing with woven palm leaves and building boats with the timber, it
was a cultural shock, but also a good lesson in resourcefulness. This
makes sense as coconut trees grow almost everywhere on the islands,
including near or at the edges of mangrove areas.</p>
<p>By the end of my fieldwork, I realized that although the mangroves
and seagrass are not well-known as economic assets on these islands,
they are living symbols of memories, skills, and cultural identity
preserved in <em>Raivaru</em> and the daily lives of these
<em>Dhatthas</em>, their family, and friends.</p>
