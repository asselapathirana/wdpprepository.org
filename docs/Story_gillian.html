<p class=MsoNormal>When I arrived in Mulah and Kolhufushi, I was welcomed into communities
shaped by water, roots, and the rhythm of daily life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the island of Mulah, I met women who know a lot about <i>Kan’doo
faa</i> (mangroves). In the Maldives, all women older than 30 are called “<i>Dhatth</i>a”.
The equivalent in Suriname is “<i>Tante</i>”, which signifies a form of <span
lang=EN-US>respect for women in both cultures.</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>I
gained a lot of insight from three <i>Dhatthas</i> whose knowledge of the
mangroves is both practical and deeply woven into the culture, and each
revealing a different facet of the mangrove’s place in island life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faaiza, the first <i>Dhattha</i>, demonstrated how to
navigate the dense tangle of roots and mud of the inland mangrove area. Hawwa,
the second <i>Dhattha</i>, spoke of visiting the mangroves mostly when family
came from other islands or the capital. She taught me about <i>kashikeyo</i>,
the screw pine fruit that also grows in mangrove areas. Her stories painted the
area as a treasured retreat, a space for connection and memory. Aisthu, the
third <i>Dhattha</i>, spent more frequent hours in the mangroves, gathering
coconut palm leaves for weaving thatch roofs and collecting screw pine fruits.
Through her hands-on work, the mangroves became a source of both livelihood and
cultural continuity. Through their stories and demonstrations, I could sense
how deeply they valued the mangroves and believed in preserving and making them
accessible for everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Across the atoll in Kolhufushi, the story is different.
Mangroves are farther from where the people live, and many people have never
walked among the roots. There, I experienced Maldivian <i>Raivaru</i> (short,
rhythmic poems) and traditional singing while conducting surveys at evening
gathering spots. <i>Dhatthas</i> recited <i>Raivaru</i> about <span lang=EN-US>daily
life, nature, and love. Since my survey focused on mangroves and seagrass, the <i>dhatthas</i>
recited one that praised</span> lagoons, reefs, and seagrass beds. Another poem
spoke of mangroves and <i>jinni</i> (supernatural beings) on an uninhabited
island. These songs and poems revealed the importance the community places on
these ecosystems as part of their cultural heritage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In these communities, the <i>Dhatthas</i> I
met are more than elders. They are keepers of ecological wisdom, stories, and
practices passed down through generations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coming from Suriname, where tropical plants and trees are
abundant and many edible fruits are found, I was struck by how much of the
coconut tree is used here. From eating the roots of a sprouted coconut to roofing
with woven palm leaves and building boats with the timber, it was a cultural
shock, but also a good lesson in resourcefulness. T<span lang=EN-US>his makes
sense as coconut trees grow almost everywhere on the islands, including near or
at the edges of mangrove areas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the end of my fieldwork, I realized that although the
mangroves and seagrass are not well-known as economic assets on these islands,
they are living symbols of memories, skills, and cultural identity preserved in
<i>Raivaru</i> and the daily lives of these <i>Dhatthas</i>, their family, and
friends. </p>
